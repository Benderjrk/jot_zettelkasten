# Wasmtime Reaches 1.0: Fast, Safe and Production Ready!

> Notes from [Lin Clark](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-1-0-fast-safe-and-production-ready)

As of today, the Wasmtime WebAssembly runtime is now at 1.0! this means
that all of us in the Bytecode Alliance agree that it is fully ready to
use in production.

In truth, we could have called Wasmtime production-ready [more than a
year ago.](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/14#issuecomment-915589031)
