# Manifesto on the Teachings of Mathematics

> [source](https://intellectualmathematics.com/manifesto/)

My general teaching philosophy can be summarised in three principles or
axioms regarding learning. They concern the source, the process, and the
goal of learning respectively.

The first axiom is this: 

* In a perfect world students pursue learning not because it is prescribed to them but rather out of a genuine desire to figure things out.
* We must teach as if our students were of this kind.
* Only by aspiring to this ideal can we bring it closer to being
  realised.
* We must not introduce any topics for which we cannot first convince
  the students that they should want to pursue it.

This is a standard very rarely met in mathematics. Everyone likes to tell
themselves that they are giving motivations for what they teach, but
very little of what passes for motivation stands up to critical scrutiny
as a motivation in the sense of the learning ideal outlined above. In
such cases, therefor, the student has not reason to pursue the topic in
question other than obedience to the dictatorial authority of the
teacher. In my view we cannot fault a student who hates mathematics in
such circumstances; if anything, I would sooner fault a student who did
not.
